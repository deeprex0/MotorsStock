# MotorsStock
A small C project, that manage a stock of motors, where the owner and the loaner can add or loan a motor, using files as a database.
The program's storage contains only 2 predefined motorcycles already rented by two members: Mohamed and Amine. You can add your own motorcycles, or you can return the motorcycles borrowed by Amine and Mohamed. 

Warning! Avoid any manual manipulation of the files; the program is already designed to automatically update all information entered by the user in the files whenever any changes are made in the program. Documentation for the program can be found in the **MiniProjet_DAIBBAR** folder.
